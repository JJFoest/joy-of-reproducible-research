## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
And use the buttons to adapt the settings (you can also just type them in between those brackets if you know the commands), Run all code above the chunk, or run the current chunk. Fun times!

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggplot(pressure, ggplot2::aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + ggplot2::geom_smooth(colour = "orange") + ggplot2::theme_classic()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Cool sunglasses
I think you'd agree, these are pretty cool, and need to be added to this document.
```{r sunglasses, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/5cw3bzhu"

knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
Upon reflection, I think these out-cool me. But that's ok, I've made peace with that. Anyway, I hope this example helps you to see you can also incorporate all kinds of things in your markdown document, even images pulled from somewhere online!

Anyways. Feel free to add your thoughts on anything below, to see how it would affect your git process :D

Actually those ones are sick 
```{r sunglasses kasia, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
url1 <- "https://i.pinimg.com/550x/ff/4e/b8/ff4eb8fb73b7bfb229b47afd77ebec9a.jpg"

knitr::include_graphics(url1)
