# Introduction

This contribution page was copied and adjusted from nayafia/contributing-templat. I have added it to give us (at FBC) an idea of what a page like this may look like.
All members of the FBC lab at AMU contribute to the joy of reproducible research.

### Thanks for your interest!

First off, thank you so much for considering contributing to joy-of-reproducible-research. It's amazing that you want to join the growing group of reproducible research afficionados.

### Why these guidelines?

>Following guidelines communicates that you respect the time of the developers. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalise your pull requests.

### What kind of contributions are we looking for?

Keep an open mind! If you have ideas about improving documentation, writing tutorials, creating workshops, adding summary notes of meetings, raising issues when you discover bugs, or fixing bugs are all examples of helpful contributions.

### We are NOT looking for:

Issues raised regarding meeting planning at the FBC, or pull requests that incorporate programming languages other than R at this point in time.

# Ground Rules
### Expectations
Please adhere to our code of conduct, and be respectful, considerate, etc. When suggesting to add new content, please include sources.

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure your files are in a non-proprietory format that is easily opened by computers using another format (e.g. csv, txt, R are all ok!)
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

### Resources
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials on GitHub: 

> * http://makeapullrequest.com/
> * http://www.firsttimersonly.com/
> * http://jlord.us/git-it/
> * http://happygitwithr.com/
> * http://ohshitgit.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request for an open-source project? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
> If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### Walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
* No need to sign anything to join this project. But projects may ask you to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, this can be added here
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), you can let collaborators know which tools they’ll need to contribute

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign necessary documentation (not applicable here): the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request 

### Small fixes

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch
> As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Security disclosures!
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email the developer instead.

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to xxx@xxx.com (example)
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at xxx@xxx.com

### Filing a bug report
> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of R and RStudio are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> 6. 
> General questions should be discussed in FBC team meetings

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a content idea.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
>
> Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Review process
### After it’s been submitted.
Jessie Foest reviews pull requests. Small requests will be merged where possible. Larger issues/Questions will be addressed at the next weekly lab meeting at FBC.

### Preferred style
R style: dplyr / tidyverse way is used in materials. 

### Commit message conventions.
No commit message conventions are used at this time.

### Explain if you use any labeling conventions for issues.
Please add a label for issues, e.g. bug, content, workshop, resources.

Thank you!
